*Warning, contains upsetting scenes*

Almost 200 million #Muslims have effectively been stripped of citizenship and are viewed as public enemy number 1, according to the #Hindu Nationalist Party BJP.
.
Over the past few weeks, Muslims across #India have been beaten, tortured, forced to drink cow urine, forced to glorify Hindu Gods, stoned, beaten and killed.
.
And what has been the response of the Muslim governments are their armies? Silence. In fact, they actually awarded Hindu Leader #Modi with a medal of honour.

Such is the situation of the Muslim Ummah. Brainwashed in the West and beaten in the East. The only solution to Hindu aggression is a state led #Jihad, to liberate the oppressed from the oppressors, with the backing of a fully fledged Islamic Political Entity.
